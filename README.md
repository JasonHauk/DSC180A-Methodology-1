Quarter_1_Checkpoint.ipynb contains the code I have been working on.

The files that are needed are located in:
    -EUR.1.test
    -EUR.14.test
    -gene_annot.txt.gz
    -GD462.GeneQuantRPKM.50FN.samplename.resk10.txt.gz

Inside of EUR.1.test and EUR.14.test we are dealing with three file types:
    -bed
    -bim
    -fam
Which are all different components of genetic data, that we need to understand what parts of the gene we're looking at and what their values are.

In general, I think everything should run as seen in the notebook. If there are any issues related to the packages not being downloaded I would simply suggest '!pip install {missing_package_name}'
